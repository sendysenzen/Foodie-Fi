-- case study #3

-- due to long fact table with approx 1000 rows, table and data input is given from the case study

-- A. Customer Journey 
-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

-- List of the sample subscribers : (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)

-- B. Data Analysis Questions
-- B.1 How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) total_rows,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) total_customer
FROM subscriptions;

-- B.2 What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - 
-- use the start of the month as the group by value

SELECT
    TO_CHAR(start_date,'Month') month_subscribed,
    COUNT(*) total_subscriber
FROM subscriptions 
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- B.3 What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? 
-- Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

SELECT 
    CAST(DATE_PART('year' , s.start_date) AS integer) year_plan_started,

    ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE DATE_PART('year' , s.start_date ) > 2020

-- B.4 What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 4 THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 END) total_churn,
    ROUND(100*SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 4 THEN 1

-- not sure why it shows 30.0 for both instead of 30.7 :(

-- B.5 How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial?
-- what percentage is this rounded to 1 decimal place?
-- assumption is that free trial always starts first. customer cannot get free trial once you subscribe
-- then the free trial always starts on row 1, and 'straight' means the churned should be in row 2
-- group by 'churn' and row number '2' as condition

-- check customers who did free trial, we need to separate customers that directly subscribe without trial

-- calculate how many counting rows per each customer, need to find the latest plan for each customer
-- we can sort descending and calculate 1st row from the most recent. When descending and filter, the
-- condition of the start_date must be put directly, otherwise we will get the 1st row_number that is

-- B.8 How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
